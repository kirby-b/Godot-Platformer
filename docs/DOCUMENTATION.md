# Development Journey

*This will be a rough summary of the development process as I started this about a month into development*

Days 1-3: Followed the tutorial to add all tilesets into the files and create the character with basic movement, skins, and animations. This part was still very similar to the tutorial, 
but I was on a newer version so there were some extra/different steps I had to take
Days 4-6: Added a tilemap, created spikes, and added a camera that follows the player. This was very interesting and very fun for me because I had to do many things very differently from the
tutorial. This was also about the time I started realizing the tutorial was going to be more of guide for what I should develop next and a small path to get there, rather than a fully correct 
tutorial.

# Tips and Tricks I learned from making this game

1. In Godot 4 to change cell size of a tilemap, you go to where it says tileset in the upper right corner and click the down arrow. From there click edit and the cell size should be there.
2. For anything you want to just follow the camera, use a canvas layer
3. Using an animated sprite is easier than changing a sprite mid game.
