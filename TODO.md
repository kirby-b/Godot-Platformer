# Todo

1. Finish all tutorial videos
2. Try to make the background less bad. It is currently very jittery and I would prefer a more smooth background
3. If it isnt covered in the tutorials, make it so the camera has a boundary it cant pass. 
4. Create base game
5. Add levels from kenney expansions
6. Add other expansion content
