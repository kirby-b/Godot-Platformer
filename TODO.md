# Todo

1. Finish all tutorial videos
2. Try to make the background less bad. It is currently very jittery and I would prefer a more smooth background
3. Find a better way to do the "fell out the world" hit box.
3. If it isnt covered in the tutorials, make it so the camera has a boundary it cant pass. 
5. Create base game
6. Add levels from kenney expansions
7. Add other expansion content
