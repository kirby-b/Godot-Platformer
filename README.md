# Godot Platformer(working title)

This is a basic godot platformer I am making from a tutorial. I will edit it to be my own later

I have no idea what I will be doing with this, but it is based on a Godot 3 tutorial so the fact I am managing to adapt this to Godot 4 is impressive enough to me.

Tutorial I followed:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn16W1Sz5bhTd1ArQQv4f-Cm
