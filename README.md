# Godot Platformer(working title)

This is a basic godot platformer I am making from a tutorial.

I have a long term plan set for this with lots of ideas. Most of these ideas are under the issues tab or already in the game.

My game is much more developed than the tutorial so it may get a little confusing. This is also because the tutorial is made with Godot 3.5 and mine is using 4.2
