# Godot Platformer(working title)

This is a basic godot platformer I made from a tutorial.

I have a long term plan set for this with lots of ideas. Most of these ideas are under the issues tab or already in the game.

My game is much more developed than the tutorial and is written in a newer version of godot (3.5 for tutorial, and mine is 4.2), but I have commented all of my scripts and plan to write more [documentation](https://github.com/kirby-b/Godot-Platformer/tree/master/docs) to help ease any confusion.

# Current Features

Includes 3 levels, 1 character, a bunch of fun enemies, lots of coins to feed the greed, and a decent UI. The game is definitely in its infancy and has a long way to go before I will be done with it, but I hope what I have is helpful to anybody who wants to use it as an example or to learn from it.
