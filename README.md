# Godot Platformer(working title)

This is a basic godot platformer I am making from a tutorial.

I have a long term plan set for this with lots of ideas. Most of these ideas are under the issues tab or already in the game.

My game is much more developed than the tutorial and is written in a newer version of godot (3.5 for tutorial, and mine is 4.2), but I have commented all of my scripts and plan to write more documentation to help ease any confusion.
